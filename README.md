chat50: a jQueryMobile + node.js demo
===

A very simple chat client built using jQueryMobile and node.js (with Express and Socket.IO) for a Hack Harvard Tech Expo. To run the app, simply execute:

    node app.js

and visit `/index.html`. Edit `index.html` and change `192.168.56.50` to the URL of your host (which might be something like `localhost`). If curious, this was developed using the [CS50 Appliance](https://manual.cs50.net/Appliance), which sets a static IP of `192.168.56.50` by default.
